# Agent Context & Memory

> This file tracks the AI agent's current state, decisions, and pending work.

---

## Current Focus
- ✅ Project initialization and planning phase complete
- ⏳ Awaiting user review of planning documents

---

## Key Decisions

### 1. Technology Stack
- **Rendering**: Three.js (WebGL) - browser-based, no installation required
- **Build Tool**: Vite - fast HMR, modern bundling
- **Physics**: Cannon.js - lightweight physics engine
- **Audio**: Howler.js - cross-browser audio

### 2. Architecture Pattern
- Voxel engine with chunk-based world management
- First-person camera with WASD + mouse controls
- Distance-based chunk loading/unloading

### 3. Scope
- Focus on exploration rather than survival/crafting mechanics
- Educational elements (historic information at landmarks)
- Web-based for accessibility

---

## Active Task
**Planning Phase - Awaiting User Approval**

Created artifacts:
- `docs/implementation_plan.md` ✅
- `docs/task.md` ✅
- `docs/architecture_overview.md` ✅
- `docs/data_contract.md` ✅
- `README.md` ✅
- `AGENT.md` ✅

---

## Pending User Input

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Review required before proceeding to implementation:
> 1. Technology stack confirmation (Three.js vs alternatives)
> 2. Scope clarification (multiplayer? survival mechanics?)
> 3. Landmark priority list
> 4. Any additional requirements

---

## Git Status
- Repository: `https://github.com/gex82/minecraft_old_SJU.git`
- Branch: `main`
- Last commit: Initial scaffolding and documentation

---

## Next Steps (After Approval)
1. Initialize Vite + Three.js project
2. Create basic voxel renderer
3. Implement camera controls
4. Design Old San Juan block palette
5. Build first landmark (El Morro)
